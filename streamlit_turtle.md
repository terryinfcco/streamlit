# Streamlit Capabilities

- Video 1
    - streamlit run main.py  - To run a streamlit program in the terminal
    - default port is 8501
    - st.title - Like an H1
    - st.header - Like an H2
    - st.subheader - Like an H3
    - st.text - Plain text
- Video 2
    - st.markdown() - just put markdown in the parentheses
    - #'s for headers - more #'s means smaller header
    - `**bold text**`
    - `*italic text*`
    - `> Put something in block quotes
    - `st.markdown("1. First Item\n 2. Second Item") # An ordered list
    - `st.code(str)` Where str = "print('Hello World')"  Not markdown - part of Streamlit
    - st.markdown(---) # Horizontal rule
    - `st.markdown('[Google](https://www.google.com/)')` # Link in Markdown
    - tables are possible - but painful looking IMHO
    - json feature st.json(json)
    - emojis possible
- Video 3
    - Metric function - able to show numbers with delta to indicate changes over time
    - tables using pandas library
    - dataframe is a table that allows sorting by clicking column headers
- Video 4
    - Images - can have captions, change height (he didn't show so ?) and width
    - Audio - can specify start time in seconds
    - Video - can specify start time in seconds
- Video 5
    - Button widget - has a value of True or False
    - text_input - type into a one line field. Can have line of code above the box
    - st.write() - writes text onto web page - not sure how this is different from st.text
- Video 6
    - Download button - takes a file object and needs a file name for the downloaded file.
- Video 7
    - Created a list of two images - when he pointed an image element at the list rather than a single image, the images ended up side by side rather than on top of each other.
    - He also created a list of captions and used that in the image element rather than one caption. And it worked.
    - Link Button - link_button, text for button and http address are parameters
- Video 8
    - Checkbox widget. Each checkbox is a separate widget. Has a value of True or False
    - Column variable allows to put checkboxes side by side rather than above and below. I suspect this is more versatile than just checkboxes
- Video 9
    - Toggle widget - slider appearance. Boolean value of True or False
    - Again uses columns to put toggles side by side
- Video 10
    - Radio buttons - Only one button active at a time.
    - A title and then a list of button titles in the parameters.
    - Uses button titles to determine which button is active (True)
    - Can use index parameter to select which button is active initially, set to None to not select a button initially
    - Can use disabled parameter to deactivate all the buttons.

    - Select Box - dropdown with 2 or more items to select from
    - First parameter is title for box, second is a list of options

    - Can be multiple default options
    - Multiselect returns a list of the selected options
- Video 13
    - Slider object - slide to value in a range
    - First parameter is title of object, 2nd and 3rd are range of slider, 4th is default value
    - Returns the value of the slider object
    - He used it to dynamically change the width of an image
- Video 14
    - Select slider object - Slider but just to specific values.
    - First parameter is title, then list with each valid value.
    - Returns value the slider is on
- Video 15
    - Text Input Object - Single line text box
    - First parameter is title above the box
    - Returns content of box - can press enter or setup a button
- Video 16
    - Number input - Like text input but with + and - at the end
    - First parameter is title above the box
    - No need to convert from string to do math like if you used text_input

    - Color Picker - parameters are a title above and the default (starting color)
    - Returns a hex code 
- Video 22
    - Create a Form 
    - Use `with` statement - then lists all widgets inside form underneath it
    - A Submit button is required - when it's pressed all the values returned by the widgets are updated
    - On the screen there's a border around the form 
- Video 23
    - Sidebar Widget
    - Uses `with` statement and widgets are indented under that
    - Those all show up on the left side of the screen in a light gray object
- Video 24
    - Columns 
    - Set up columns then add widgets to the columns using with statement
    - widgets for each column indented under that columns with statement
- Video 25
    - Tabs
    - Create tabs `tab1, tab2, tab3 = ['Football', 'Basketball', 'Hockey']
    - Then with statements for each tab followed by that tab's widgets
- Video 26
    - Expander widget - shows single line with a title (he used 'See explanation'), then there's a dropdown with the full explanation. 
- Video 27
    - Container widget. Uses with statement, can have a border. They go one above the other when multiple ones exist.
    - He used an expander above the container - then when he clicked the expander all the widgets in the container appeared at once.
- Video 28
    - Empty widget. He showed a loop counting down seconds using the write widget. That created as many writes to the screen as seconds in the count. 
    - Then he put the loop in an empty widget and the write statement overwrote the previous write statement so there was only one line of text on the screen.
- Video 29
    - Multiple pages. He added a sidebar to the webpage and a folder named pages to the project. Each python/streamlit program that he put in the folder showed up on the screen in the sidebar.
    - The programs in the pages folder are full streamlit programs, including imports and widgets.
